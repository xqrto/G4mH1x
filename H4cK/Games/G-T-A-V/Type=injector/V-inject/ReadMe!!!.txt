Install V-inject.
Note that it comes from my github.
The name is xqrto. Don't pay attention to all the crap repos, just put it in the G4mH1x repo. 
There you'll find what you need. Now for the part about how V-inject works. Go to your steam folder 

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam"

 Make a new folder called dlls Put your GTA-V mod dll in there. 
 
Don't trust all dlls on the market and especially not their launchers. 
Make sure you only get the dll, no launch pads or anything else, as launchpads are 50% infected with viruses when free 
(that's where I come in :) I save humanity from this crap). 
Now start V inject. The tool should take a while, then my V inject logo should appear and if you've done everything correctly, 
the GTA V shortcut that you need on the desktop should be with the injector. 
be linked if you have 2 links at once, one of them is just a bug and will disappear again
