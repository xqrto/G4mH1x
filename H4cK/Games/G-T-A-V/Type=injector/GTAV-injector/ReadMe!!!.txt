GTA V Inject is a software to inject DLLs into the GTA process.
Start the injector and GTA V. When GTA 5 has started,
minimize the game so that you see the icon on the monitor or use (alt-duck)
to exit full screen in the start menu. Now drag the DLL into the icon and it will be injected.
If your antivirus sees xylo.exe as a threat, it's because xylo is my injector on which GTA V Inject runs.
I don't intend to bring viruses or anything else onto the PC as I've gotten these kinds of things myself.
I'm looking for a secure injector, so only download this app from my GITHUB or the official xqrto website if it's online.
 Thanks for using my injector. If the injector is too cumbersome for you, use my alternative injector (but not in online mode)
  as it needs the xylo.dll and it isn't undetected online yet. The alternate injectors are in the repo
